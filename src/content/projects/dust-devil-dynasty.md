lessons:
  - Prototyping physical bartending first established the tactile tone and informed every other system decision.
  - Resource telemetry linking mine output to town prosperity made it clear where to balance risk and reward.
  - Early investment in tooling for building renovation keeps level design and narrative aligned on environmental storytelling.

## Executive Summary
Inherit a derelict saloon and a collapsed mine in Redemption Gulch, a forgotten frontier town on the edge of the Arizona territory. Dust Devil Dynasty fuses hands-on simulation with a sweeping tycoon arc: pour the drinks, swing the pickaxe, and reinvest every dollar to restore the town from ghostly husk to booming dynasty.

## Premise & Setting
Redemption Gulch was abandoned when the Devil's Vein dried up. As the last heir, you receive two properties: the boarded-up Gilded Garter Saloon and the collapsed Last Chance Mine. Your first job is survival - get the saloon open. Soon you discover your relative's journal hinting at a deeper vein and a plan to resurrect the town.

## Core Loop
1. **Work:** Tend bar, cook meals, clear rubble, and mine ore in first person.
2. **Earn:** Pocket cash, haul raw ore, and refine it into high-value ingots.
3. **Invest:** Upgrade gear, hire staff, and purchase automation for both saloon and mine.
4. **Expand:** Buy deeds to abandoned buildings, renovate them, and unlock new revenue streams that revive the town.

## Systems Overview
- **Saloon Operations:** Pour whiskey via gesture-based minigames, manage a physical ledger, clean up after brawls, and hire staff across bartending, entertainment, and security roles.
- **Mine Management:** Clear collapses, lay track, spot ore veins, and upgrade from pan to sluice to full smelter while fighting off cave-ins and rival claim-jumpers.
- **Town Revitalization:** Acquire and rebuild the general store, hotel, bank, blacksmith, and more. Each building introduces mechanics, adds NPCs, and visually transforms Main Street.
- **Living Town Simulation:** A prosperity meter tracks population, crime, and demand. NPC relationships unlock blueprints, side quests, and economic modifiers.

## Art & Technical Vision
Stylized low-poly realism inspired by Synty's Western packs, with lighting that brightens as prosperity returns. Diegetic UI keeps immersion - balances are reviewed in a desk ledger, mission notices on the town board, and subtle HUD elements show health, stamina, and equipped tools.

## Player Experience Goals
Players feel the grind and glory of reclaiming a town themselves. Early sessions are sweaty and manual; midgame introduces staff management and automation; late game becomes a strategic dance of expansion, civic planning, and story-driven decisions. Every investment leaves a visible mark on Redemption Gulch.
