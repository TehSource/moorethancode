I have always loved the phrase _more than code_. Building games asks for so much more than clever scripts—it takes world building, playtesting empathy, production ritual, and a willingness to leave the debugger and talk to real players. This site collects all of that gravity in one place.

## What the portfolio is solving

- **One canonical home.** Recruiters, collaborators, and friends no longer need to chase down scattered builds or pitch decks.
- **Context, not just binaries.** Every project breakdown now includes the design proofs, tooling shots, and telemetry I use to ship confidently.
- **A living devlog.** Shipping is a loop, not a moment. The devlog will track prototypes, wins, and the inevitable pivots.

## How the site is organized

1. **Projects:** Case studies for the systems-driven games I am actively developing, complete with playable links where possible.
2. **Devlog:** Weekly-to-monthly entries that document production progress, tooling experiments, and lessons that deserve to be remembered.
3. **About:** A concise view of my background, the pillars that guide my work, and how to get in touch.

## What comes next

If any of that sounds useful, stay tuned or drop a note on LinkedIn. Thanks for checking out the new home for MooreThanCode.
